# Crack Offenders in the Federal Prison System

#########

*This project will be done in conjunction with the [Brennan Center For Justice at NYU] (http://www.brennancenter.org/)*

## Background

In 1986, Congress enacted legislation that created a disparate sentencing structure for offenders convicted of crimes related to powder cocaine versus crack cocaine, even though the two substances of scientifically identical. 

The structure created mandatory minimum penalties triggered based upon the weight of the drug. The disparity between the weights was 100:1, meaning that it took 100 times more powder cocaine to receive a mandatory minimum sentence. For example, if you trafficked 5 grams of crack cocaine you received a mandatory five-year sentence, and if you trafficked 500 grams of powder cocaine you received a mandatory five-year sentence. 

In 1988, Congress created a mandatory five-year sentence for offenders in possession of crack cocaine, whereas possession of powder cocaine carried a maximum of one-year sentence.

The result was disproportionately long sentences for (mostly black) crack offenders who possessed or trafficked less drugs.

In 2010, Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) to reduce the weight ratio from 100:1 to 18:1 for crack versus powder cocaine weights triggering the mandatory penalties.

This statute has not been applied to offenders already sentenced before the day the FSA was enacted (August 3, 2010). Defendants continue to appeal to the courts for retroactive application of the FSA. Nevertheless, *literally thousands* of crack offenders continue to serve sentences under the old sentencing structure, even though Congress made amendments to make the sentence structure more just.

## Assignment

The Brennan Center is interested in a data visualization product that illustrates the thousands of prisoners continuing to serve sentences for crack offenses under the pre-FSA structure. 

Your data will come from two primary sources: the United States Sentencing Commission’s data and reports on the retroactive application of the Fair Sentencing Act ([here](http://www.ussc.gov/Research/Retroactivity_Analyses/Fair_Sentencing_Act/20110128_Crack_Retroactivity_Analysis.pdf) and [here](hhttp://www.ussc.gov/Research_and_Statistics/Federal_Sentencing_Statistics/FSA_Amendment/2014-01_USSC_Prelim_Crack_Retro_Data_Report_FSA.pdf) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ annual reports on the Prisoners in the United States (e.g., [here](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p12ac.pdf) for 2012 version, but these are available as part of the [Prisoner Series](http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbse&sid=40) going back to 1980).

We have pulled some initial data sets from these sourcecs above to get you started.
