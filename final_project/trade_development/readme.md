# US Trade Development

#########

*This project will be done in conjunction with the [US Trade and Development Agency](http://www.ustda.gov/pubs/index.asp)*

## Background

The US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) is an independent U.S. Government foreign assistance agency that is funded by the U.S. Congress.

The USTDA's mission is to help companies create U.S. jobs through the export of U.S. goods and services for priority development projects in emerging economies. USTDA links U.S. businesses to export opportunities by funding project planning activities, pilot projects, and reverse trade missions while creating sustainable infrastructure and economic growth in partner countries.

The USTDA is interested in showing how the projects it has funded have changed over the last decade, both by region and by topic.

## Assignment

The USTDA is interested in a visualization that shows how the projects it has funded have changed over the last decade, both by region and my topic.

The USTDA has shared data with us, however we have not received permission to share the raw data yet. As a result, you will be able to obtain the data on our blackboard site.

In particular, you will be comparing the efficacy of USTDA projects (in terms of exports generated) by country and industry, and compare that information to data about each country's institutions (their corruption rating, industry breakdown, GDP growth, etc). This will require you to find additional data from sources like the [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG) or [Transparency International](http://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/overview).
