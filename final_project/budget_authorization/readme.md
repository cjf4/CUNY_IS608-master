# Massachusetts Budget Authorization

#########

*This project will be done in conjunction with the [House Committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets](https://malegislature.gov/Committees/House/H32)*

## Background

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has a Capital Budget (the budget it uses to build roads and structures, among other things) is on the order of $2 Billion per year. A large portion of this budget goes to *tens of thousands* of outside vendors, who provide the Commonwealth with support on hundreds of major projects.

The Commonwealth has already dedicated itself to the open presentation of this budget data, through the [Open Checkbook Program](http://opencheckbook.itd.state.ma.us/analytics/saw.dll). However, the team at the MA House Committee on Bonding is interested in more interactive ways of seeing their data.

In particular, each payment made to a vendor is done under a certain 'authorization', an ID connecting the payment to funds that were set aside specifically for that purpose.

## Assignment

The House Committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets is interesting in an interactive visualization that will all them to see how money has been spent for a particular authorization, and how much money is left under that authorization. The ability to 'drill-down' into this data to see details on specific payments would also be helpful.

All data from the 2010-2014 budget has been gathered from the the [Open Checkbook Website](http://opencheckbook.itd.state.ma.us/analytics/saw.dll). In addiont, data on authorization amounts has been provided directly by the Commonwealth.

This project is slightly complicated by the size of the raw data (about 1.5GB, 6.8 million rows). A sample has been provided here. However, *your instructor is in the process of producing normalized & summarized versions of the data*. To see the full data set, please contact your instructor.
